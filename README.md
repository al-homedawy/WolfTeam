# WolfTeam Multi-hack (alias: "Project Rain")

### Description

WolfTeam is a popular first-person shooter game. This hack includes AimBot, super jump, super speed and a number of Direct3D modifications like chams, etc.

### Purpose

During my teenage years, I enjoyed developing hacks for many of the games I played. There were a number of games that I hacked, including, GunBound, MapleStory, Gunz, Combat Arms and more. Eventually, I started to commercialize my hacks online and earned a significant amount of money as a result.

### Project Layout

In order to use hack, you must inject this library into WolfTeam's memory space. I have provided a number of DLL injectors on my GitHub for this purpose.

### Disclaimer

Use at your own risk.
