WolfTeam (letitrain's WolfTeam Multi-Hack)

  The source-code is well commented for those looking to understand it functioned. Looking to "beat around the bush" and not bypass
the memory protection which was enforced by Apex at the time I chose to set hardware breakpoints. The obvious downside to hardware
breakpoints is that you have four breakpoints so you need to mastermind a plan to get multiple hacks working with just four
breakpoints like I did.

  Alternatively you can rely on single-step breakpoints to set an unlimited amount of hardware breakpoints. The choice is yours.
